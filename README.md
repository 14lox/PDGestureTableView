PDGesturedTableView
===================

Amazing Mailbox-like UITableView subclass.

Check out the **example app**. You'll see implementing this powerful control isn't hard at all.

## Features

- Let the user **slide cells** to perform different actions at **right and left**.
- Super easy **customization**.
- A **left and right margin** can be set to let the user swipe between different table views.
- **Block-driven**. No silly delegates :)

## Wish list

- Be able to **move cells** with a long press and pan gesture.

## LICENSE

You can use it for whatever you want, however you want. I just would love to know if you're using it in any project of yours.
