PDGesturedTableView
===================

Great Mailbox-like UITableView subclass.

![Example app running on 2 iPhones](https://raw.github.com/Dromaguirre/PDGesturedTableView/master/Screenshots/github-pdgesturedtableview-1.png)

Check out the **example app**. You'll see implementing this powerful control isn't hard at all.

## Features

- **Multiple actions** in a single slide depending on the lenght the user slided (as Mailbox's does).
- Super easy **customization**.
- A **left and right margin** can be set to let the user swipe between different table views.
- **Block-driven**. No silly delegates :)

## Wish list

- âœ… ~~**Multiple actions** in a single slide depending on the lenght the user slided (as Mailbox's does).~~
- **Move cells** with a long press and pan gesture.

## LICENSE

You can use it for whatever you want, however you want. I just would love to know if you're using it in any project of yours.
