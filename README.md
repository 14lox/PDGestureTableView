Check out the **example app**. You'll see implementing this powerful control isn't hard at all.

## Features

- **Multiple actions** in a single slide depending on the lenght the user slided.
- **Tap and hold** to move cells.
- A **UIView** can be set to be shown **when there's no content** on the table view.
- Super easy **customization**.
- A **left and right margin** can be set to let the user swipe between different table views.
- **Block-driven**. No silly delegates :)

## CocoaPods

You can install PDGesturedTableView through CocoaPods adding the following to your Podfile:

	pod 'PDGesturedTableView'

## Wish List

- ~~**Multiple actions** in a single slide depending on the lenght the user slided (Mailbox feature).~~
- ~~A **UIView** can be set to be shown **when there's no content** on the table view (Mailbox feature).~~
- ~~**CocoaPods** support.~~
- ~~**Move cells** with a long press and pan gesture.~~
- **Autoscroll** when the current moving cell is near the edge of the screen. **I'll need some help with this**.

## Requirements

- iOS 7 or higher.
- Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).

You can use it for whatever you want, however you want. I just **[would love to know](mailto:dromaguirre@gmail.com)** if you're using it in any project of yours.
